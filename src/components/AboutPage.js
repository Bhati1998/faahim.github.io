              <p>Hi there! <span className="hand-wave">ðŸ‘‹</span></p>
              <h1>I'm Afiur Rahman Fahim.</h1>
              <p>But thats quite long! So, I like to use <strong>Faahim.</strong> :)</p>
              <p>I'm a 22 year old developer based in Bangladesh. I specialize in JavaScript and my main area of interest is Front-End Development. I LOVE developing tools/sites that solves problem or help make someones life easier. In shrot, I like impactful work.</p>
              <h3>Skills</h3>
              <p>I belive in tool agonistic skills. Being in a industry that moves at the speed of light, it sometimes doesn't matters what frameworks/tools I'm familier with. Because tools/frameworks are so fickle these days that they can become absolete within months! What matters more is how fast can I learn and make myself comfortable with newer technology. I believe I'm a quick learner. I priotize concepts over techniques.</p>
              <p>However, my current skillset includes <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Redux</strong>, <strong>Firebase</strong>, <strong>SASS</strong>, <strong>Boostrap</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong> etc. And thats excluding all the common (yet sometime complex) build/workflow tools like Webpack, Babel etc. And oh, No progressbar showing I'm 93% expert at React, Sorry.</p>
              <p>Simplicity, Though overused (and sometime misused) as a term, Is something I really value. I like to build build solutions that are simple yet interactive for the users.</p>
              <p>Besides coding, I'm also very passionate about travelling and reading. I feel the world is a book that was given to me for exploring when I was born, and I don't wanna die before reading all the pages. I plan to become a nomad someday and explore the endless beauty that this planet homes.</p>
